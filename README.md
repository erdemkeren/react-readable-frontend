This is the project I developed for the final assessment project for
Udacity's React & Redux course. The goal of this project is
to meet the specifications defined by the project specification.

## Initialization Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To get the project installed and launched, use `npm install` and `npm start` respectively.

## Application Backend

This app has been written to work on the backend API provided by Udacity.
The backend API, server and installation instructions can be found at [Readable API Server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) repository.

### API & Application Communication

This application needs environment configuration to work properly.
*The default environment file is not ignored to avoid additional installation steps.*

The environment location: `src_root/.env.js`
The environment example location: `src_root/.env.js.example`

## Usage

Here is the key usage instructions:

- The breadcrumbs can be found on every page and used to navigate in the application.
